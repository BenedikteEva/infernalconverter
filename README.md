<b>Infernal converter converts latin letters into infernal letters.</b>

Infernal is dnd language.  

This is only for fun and a small gift for my son who is a dungeon master and needed some documents written in infernal for his players to translate. 

I have used the Barazhad Font made by "Pixel Sagas" - "Neale Davidson". which is shareware so I guess it is okay to use for this non-commercial project.

Besides using React I have also used react-to-print from this repository https://github.com/gregnb/react-to-print which is a great tool for any react project that requires perfect printing.
